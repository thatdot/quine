summary: Incrementally approximates pi using Leibniz' formula
description: |-
  Incrementally approximates pi using Leibniz' formula -- the arctangent function is incrementally
  (corecursively) computed along :improved_by edges, and each arctangent approximation is quadrupled
  to yield an approximation of pi.
