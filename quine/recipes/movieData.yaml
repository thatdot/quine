  when an actor is also the director of a movie.

  This recipe is part of the Quine Ingest Stream blog series. This time, we'll 
  work with `CSV` data exported from IMDb to answer the question; *"Which actors 
  have acted in and directed the same movie?"*

# Ingest Streams connect to data sources and establish how data is processed and transformed
