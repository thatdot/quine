contributor: https://github.com/emanb29
summary: Ethereum Blockchain model with tag propagation
description: |-
  Models data on the thoroughgoing Ethereum blockchain using tag propagation
  to track the flow of transactions from flagged accounts.

  Newly-mined Ethereum transaction metadata is imported via a Server-Sent Events data
  source. Transactions are grouped by the block in which they were mined then imported
  into the graph. Each wallet address is represented by a node, linked by an edge
  to each transaction sent or received by that account, and linked by an edge to any
  blocks mined by that account. Quick queries allow marking an account as "tainted".
  The tainted flag is propagated along outgoing transaction paths via Standing Queries
  to record the least degree of separation between a tainted source and an account
  receiving a transaction. Canonical (node-provided) capitalization is maintained where
  possible, with `toLower` being used for idFrom-based ID resolution to reflect the
  case-insensitive nature of bytestrings (eg addresses, hashes) used by Ethereum.
