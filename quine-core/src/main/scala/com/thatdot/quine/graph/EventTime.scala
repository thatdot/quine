/** Timestamp for providing a strict total ordering on events observed along one clock. See
  * [[ActorClock]] for a concrete example of such a clock.
  *
  * There are three components to the timestamp:
  *
  *   - '''Most significant 42 bits store milliseconds since Jan 1 1970 UTC.''' This part should be
  *     mostly synchronized across the distributed Quine system, and this is important for being
  *     able to query a historical timestamp and get a mostly consistent response even when results
  *     are distributed across different nodes and machines. This is enough bits to represent
  *     timestamps until 2109 (see `java.time.Instant.EPOCH.plusMillis(1L << 42)` for a more
  *     precise max timestamp).
  *
  *   - '''Middle 14 bits store an actor-local timestamp sequence number.''' This is an artificial
  *     counter for disambiguating times that fall in the same millisecond but which are otherwise
  *     logically different (eg. the node processes multiple messages in a millisecond, and events
  *     that occurred due to different messages get a logically different timestamp thanks to this
  *     sequence number).
  *
  *   - '''Least significant 8 bits store an actor-local event sequence number.''' This is an
  *     artificial counter that makes it possible to give a strict total order to events that
  *     occurred at the same logical time. This makes it possible to give every event in the node
  *     journal a unique key, which enables more efficient persistence layer implementations.
  *
  * @param eventTime an actor local time that can provide a strict total order over events
