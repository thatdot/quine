/** Manages SKIP optimizations for a [family of] queries, eg (SKIP n LIMIT m, SKIP n+m LIMIT o, ...)
  *
  * This main service this actor provides is maintaining a [[BroadcastHub]] ([[queryHub]]) that allows "resuming"
  * a source of query results for [[QueryFamily]]. This means that queries in the same "family", ie, differing only in
  * their SKIP/LIMIT clauses, can re-use the same materialized state. This can have substantial impact when dealing with
  * query families involving waking many nodes, such as pagination over a supernode's edges.
  *
  * NB This actor is only used from within a JVM, so it does not need (or have) the additional infrastructure to
  * work as a QuineRef. Accordingly, its messages also do not extend QuineMessage
  *
  * INV: queryFamily must have no [[Expr.Parameter]]s
  *
  * @param graph       the graph over which [[QueryFamily]] will be run
  * @param QueryFamily the canonical query representing the family of queries this actor should manage (eg, if this
  *                    actor optimizes queries like "MATCH (n) RETURN n SKIP $x LIMIT $y", the QueryFamily will be
  *                    (the compiled form of) "MATCH (n) RETURN n". Capitalized for implementation (pattern-matching)
  *                    convenience.
  * @param atTime      the timestamp at which [[QueryFamily]] will be run against the graph
