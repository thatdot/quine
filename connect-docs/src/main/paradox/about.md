# About Quine

Quine is the open source streaming graph project created by the team at thatDot, a Portland, Oregon-based streaming event processing company. Released under the MIT with Commons Clause license in February 2022, Quine already boasts almost a dozen prominent users in the systems management, security, and CDN/networking industries.

Development for Quine began in 2014 when thatDot founder and CEO Ryan Wright decided he'd rebuilt the same event processing microservice platform one too many times. In 2015, Wright partnered with DARPA, through its Transparent Computing program, to accelerate development.

The decision to open source the Quine graph streaming engine underscores the thatDot teamâ€™s conviction that the best infrastructure software thrives within an open, diverse community of contributors and that well-made software freely available benefits everyone.
