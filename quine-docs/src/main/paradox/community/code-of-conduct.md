# Code of Conduct

## Code of Conduct for the Quine Community

thatDot is dedicated to providing the best community experience possible for the Quine community. Our goal is to provide the opportunity for community participants to learn, communicate, contribute and collaborate. The Community Code of Conduct governs how we all participate and behave. As such we are committed to creating a diverse, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form. Any form of written, social or verbal communication that can be offensive or harassing to any community member, participant or staff is not allowed. Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community.

## Expectations for All Community Members

### Be kind.

All community participants should feel welcome, regardless of their personal background. Please be polite, courteous, and considerate to fellow participants. No offensive comments regarding to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion will be tolerated.

### Be respectful.

We expect all participants to be respectful when communicating with other participants, even when differences of opinion arise. Participants are expected to work together to resolve disagreements constructively and respectfully. Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Please be patient.

### Reach out and ask for help.

Please inform our community operator or forum moderator if you feel a violation has taken place and our staff will address the situation. Ask questions if you are unsure and be helpful to those who ask. You can also contact @link:[community@quine.io](mailto:community@quine.io)

### Communicate and collaborate.

The concept of the community is based on working together and participants will gain the most from the community by actively participating and communicating effectively. As such, we encourage collaboration and communication as long as they are conducted in a positive and constructive way.

### Continue.

This list is not exhaustive or complete. Please use your own good judgement on proper behavior and contribute to a productive and pleasant community experience.

## How To Report Inappropriate Behavior

If a community participant engages in harassing behavior, community staff may take any action they consider appropriate, including expulsion from the community. If you are being harassed or know of someone else is being harassed, please inform our community staff immediately by contacting @link:[community@quine.io](mailto:community@quine.io)

We expect participants to abide by these rules at all community-related activities. Thank you for your cooperation.
