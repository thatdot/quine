# About Quine

Quine is the open source streaming graph project created by the team at thatDot,
a Portland, Oregon-based streaming event processing company. Released under the
MIT with Commons Clause license in February 2022, Quine already boasts almost a
dozen prominent users in the systems management, security, and CDN/networking
industries.

Development for Quine began in 2014 when thatDot founder and CEO Ryan Wright
decided he'd rebuilt the same event processing microservice platform one too
many times. In 2015, Wright partnered with DARPA, through its Transparent
Computing program, to accelerate development.

The decision to open source the Quine graph streaming engine underscores the
thatDot team’s conviction that the best infrastructure software thrives within
an open, diverse community of contributors and that well-made software freely
available benefits everyone.
